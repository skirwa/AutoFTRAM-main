R –  Rules.
m – Minimum number of items m required to generate k rules. This can be derived from the user-defined parameter k. For instance, when k=30, the minimum number of required items m is 4.
Tidset – Transaction Identifier Set.
I – A set of items items I = (i1, i2, i3, ..., im). If a set I_ = {is, is+1, is+2, ..., ie} is a subset of the set I , then the support of the rules generated using the set I_ should be greater than or equal to Ms, and the confidence of the rules generated by the set I_ should be greater than or equal to Mc.
K - Parameter set by users to indicate the number of association rules to be found.
DB – A database or a set of transactions (T1, T2, T3,… Tn), where each transaction comprises a subset of items and has a transaction identifier.
Set of items I (i, j) – Set items in a transaction identifier. 
Sup(i) – Support value of item i.
Conf(i) – Confidence value of item i
Minsup – Minimum support value.
Minconf – Minimum confidence value.
